	<h1>Using Webform View to apply contextual filters</h1>
	<p>Your view may be constructed to take additional contextual filters,
  and when configuring your webform you may wish to pass that argument in.
  </p>
  Say your content to be listed was tagged with an 'audience' vocabulary,
  and you wanted to re-use the view in different webforms for each audience.
  It may often be easier to just make some alternate displays and use them,
  but if your list is large, the arguments are easier.
  </p>
	<h2>Set up the View</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>In Views UI, under "Advanced", use "Contextual filters: Add"</li>
		<li>Select the rule for filtering, and use Views UI preview to confirm it
    behaves as expected.</li>
	</ul>
  <h2>Configure the webform</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In the webform node, edit the webform embedded view component.</li>
    <li>You can enter your arguments for filtering there.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, this method is limited to webform editor control and gets set
  once there.
  If you want the filter to be more dynamic or contextual, you may be better 
  off just <a href="https://drupal.org/comment/8141587#comment-8141587">
  using Views Contextual Filters directly</a> to pull arguments from the 
  environment.
